# BookStore Application

This is a JavaFX application for managing a bookstore with multiple user levels: Admin, Manager, and Librarian.

- **Admin**: Has access to books, statistics, and all user data. They can add and remove other users from the system.
- **Manager**: Has access to books and statistics.
- **Librarian**: Can only access book-related functionalities.

## Testing with Mockito

Mockito has been used extensively to test the software.  
Below is a video that shows the automated testing of adding, updating, and deleting a user.  
I have simply run the program â€” everything shown is done automatically.
